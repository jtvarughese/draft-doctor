As a sports buff I was tired of teams being shocked that players they signed or drafted were injured the following season especially when the common fan knew that player was at a high risk of injury.
At Sports Doctor, I analyzed the risk of injuries in collegiate and professional athletes. The goal was to equate a player's biometrics, injury history, and the spectrum of injuries associated at their position to determine if a player is at risk of injury or re-injury. I created an algorithm to identify certain key parameters such as age, weight, injury history, minutes played, amongst other identifiers to output a risk percentage.
Through careful research of ESPN and the American Medical Association, I determined which parameters required more importance, for instance: weight and previous injury held a higher significance than minutes played and position specific injury. To validate if the algorithm was accurate, I retroactively entered players that were injured or healthy in last year's NBA season. The findings concluded the algorithm worked. The algorithm was written in Ruby code and embedded in JavaScript code.
