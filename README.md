 At Sports Doctor, I analyzed the risk of injuries in collegiate and professional athletes. The goal is to equate a player's biometrics, injury history, and the spectrum of injuries associated at their position to determine if a player is at risk of injury or re-injury. I used an algorithm to identify certain key parameters such as age, weight, injury history, minutes played, amongst other identifiers to output a risk percentage.
 Through careful research, I determined which parameters required more importance, for instance: weight and previous injury held a higher significance than minutes played and position specific injury. To validate if the algorithm was accurate, I retroactively entered players that were injured or healthy in last year's NBA season. The findings concluded the algorithm worked.
